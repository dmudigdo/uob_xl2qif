# uob_xl2qif

Python program that converts UOB Singapore transaction export file from Excel to QIF format

##Background

Since 2008, I have been storing my bank transactions on clearcheckbook.com, which accepts QIF files. UOB Singapore does not export QIF files, so on clearcheckbook.com, I had to tediously enter each transaction by hand. Until I did a Coursera course on Python, and subsequently wrote this little Python program, which uses Beautiful Soup.
